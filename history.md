### Version 0.6, 2013-10-06

- Option to launch Node debug without -brk (disable interruption of Node.js app on the first line).
 Check Help (<kbd>F1</kbd>) Debug page on -debug-brk option.
- [#61](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/61) set debugging port in Preferences.
 Now you can debug several Node.js apps in the same time (but in different Eclipse instances).
- [Extended Help with examples and links][10]. 
 Ready for contribution: just edit online with GitHub.
- Chromium JS Editor now has Outline support as Node Editor
<!--
[#49](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/49) support black background color schemes
 for Chromium JS Editor (used in debug mode). That is good for Aptana users where default theme is dark.
-->
- TODO: 2 items below have run into problem <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19157302/eclipse-plugin-development-saved-launchconfiguration-overrides-launchtype> ,
 that limits their usability (also warning in Help). Decision was made not to postpone release of features above
 and have more frequent releases
	- more support for [CoffeeScript][1] (launch `coffee` util in RUN or DEBUG mode) & [TypeScript][2] (`tsc` compiler).
	 Note that full featured CoffeeScript debugging [#12][12] is not yet implemented.
	 Do you know Java library for parsing `coffee`-generated SourceMaps? [#12][12]
	- [#57](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/57) running app.js with node-dev, forever, supervisor, nodemon etc.
	 Default preferences to `node-dev`.

### Version 0.5, 2013-09-08

- [#59](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/59) setting environment variables in Launch (Run/Debug Configuration)
- [#26](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/26) [CoffeeScript support](http://coffeescript.org): run `*.coffee` files 
<!-- 
and `*.litcoffee` files,
 associate `*.litcoffee` ( [Literate CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate) ) with Markdown Editor.
 Check for [letarate programming](http://www.google.com.hk/search?q=letarate+programming).
-->
- [#17](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/17) bundle [Express](http://expressjs.org/) and CoffeeScript into jar files.
 This lets you install them even if you don't have admin permission on computer that you use, or if you want play quickly with Node.js 
 and don't remember how to do `npm install express -g`. Note this bundle is of current Express/CoffeeScript versions, and doesn't
 check for your Node.js version compatibility (the latest version is assumed).
- [#66](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/66) built-in (Help -> Help Contents) and
 [online help](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/tree/master/org.nodeclipse.help/contents). It is open-sourced and written in Markdown.
 [Welcome to contribute](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/tree/master/org.nodeclipse.help/contents):
 just edit Markdown files online, then send pull request.
- [#40](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/40) [maven](http://maven.apache.org/) build.
 Building Nodeclipse is now the easiest `mvn package` from command line. [Check README](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1#maven-build)

* [Publish](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/quickstart) on Eclipse marketplace
* [t#3 [Feature Request] allow passing arguments](https://github.com/tomotaro1065/nodeclipse/issues/3)
	You can pass arguments to application and node.js setting on [Debug configration...]-[Node Application]-[&ltyour configration name&gt]-[Arguments].<br/>
	You can also set arguments on [Run configuration...].<br/>
	![Screen shot](img/Arguments.png)
* [n#2 on x64 windows doesn't find NodeJS dir automatically](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse/issues/2)
* [#5 When creating Node project and folder already exists, then add only .project file and don't add 3 files (README.md, hello-world-server.js, package.json)](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/5)
* [#6 Add Express Project in main menu under File -> New (in Node perspective)](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/6)<br/>
