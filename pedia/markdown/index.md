I have already got accustomed to GitHub style, that is link without extension `[click me](file)`,
that is there exist `file.md` and it will be compiled to `file.html`.
Markdown link in `<>` are not yet supported even on GitHub, e.g. `<file>` is not converted to link to `file.html`
It only works for full URL like `<htttp://www.github.com>` <htttp://www.github.com>

Also, in issue tracker links like `[link_13](../13)` doesn't work : [link_13](../13)
but `[link_13](13)` [link_13](13) is OK
