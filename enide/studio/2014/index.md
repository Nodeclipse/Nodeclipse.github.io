# Enide Studio 2014

[README](README)

Enide Studio 2014 is preview release based on Eclipse 4.4M4. 
While I use it myself daily since January 2014, some bugs in Eclipse newer feature are possible.
Nodeclipse and Enide plugins are the same released versions.

The intention is to let you try this Eclipse package (that has a lot of improvements)
without separate step of installing needed plugins.
