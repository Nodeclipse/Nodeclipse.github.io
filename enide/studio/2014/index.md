# Enide Studio 2014

[README](README)

Enide Studio 2014 is preview release based on Eclipse 4.4M4. 
While I use it myself daily since January 2014, some bugs in Eclipse newer feature are possible.
Nodeclipse and Enide plugins are the same released versions.

## History

2014-02-28 0.11-preview
The intention is to let you try this Eclipse package (that has a lot of improvements)
without separate step of installing needed plugins.
