This is the most feature reach distribution of Nodeclipse.

As [mentioned in Marketplace entry](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/enide-studio-2014)

> Enide Studio 2014 was initially released as stand-alone product (version 0.11-preview)
and this marketplace entries to allow updates.

> Time showed as Windows user, I [Paul] could not also check if there are issues on other platforms, so only plugins distribution will follow. 
This may change if anyone would join as Linux/OS X co-maintainer.

> You should install plugins in recent Eclipse distribution. Otherwise check individual plugins for there compatibility. 
E.g. Nodeclipse plugin should work with 3.x and 4.x Eclipse versions.

> You can still download and use Enide Studio 2014 0.11-preview but are strongly advised to update
Eclipse to 4.4 stable and Nodeclipse to the latest (0.17 as of writing).

Enide Studio 2014 0.11 was preview release based on Eclipse 4.4M4. 
While I used it myself daily since January 2014, some bugs in Eclipse newer feature are possible.
Nodeclipse and Enide plugins are the same released versions.

Add `-showLocation` to launch shortcut for Enide Studio `eclipse.exe` to display workspace path in window title.
