NOTE: This is [open-source article, that you can extend](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/www.nodeclipse.org/tree/gh-pages/_posts).

For Windows and MacOS Joyent provides standard packages. Just download from <http://www.nodejs.org/download/>.
However for Linux things are a bit complicated.

Used materials:
- <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-and-run-a-node-js-app-on-centos-6-4-64bit>
- <https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation>

## Node.js installation on CentOS/Linux

A straightforward way, that works on any Linux, is to compile sources. 
There are also pre-built packages for some Lunix distribution,
see Node Wiki [Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
But the later is not maintained be Joyent (company behing Node), so support & freshness level may vary.

### Preparation

	yum -y update
	yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
	
or with Package Manager (GUI)

### Node.js installation CheatSheet

	cd /usr/src
	
	wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.17/node-v0.10.17.tar.gz
	
	tar zxf node-v0.10.17.tar.gz
	cd node-v0.10.17
	
	./configure


It will read the properties of our system to prepare compiler flags. Ie. it could be a system architecture (32/64bit, CPU specific flags etc). With it, we're ready to actually compile the source now. To do that, just type:

	make


This is probably the most time-consuming task here: on my example droplet it took about 6 minutes and 34 seconds to complete. When we're done, we need to make this available system-wide:

	make install


#### As Node Wiki says

	tar -zxf node-v0.6.18.tar.gz #Download this from nodejs.org
	cd node-v0.6.18
	./configure && make && sudo make install

or with `git`

	git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
	cd node
	git checkout v0.6.18 #Try checking nodejs.org for what the stable version is
	./configure && make && sudo make install


### Other

This <http://www.chrisabernethy.com/installing-node-js-on-centos-redhat/>
suggests using [Node.js spec file](http://www.chrisabernethy.com/wp-content/downloads/nodejs.spec).
Well, maybe for someone this way is better.
