And convenient OS CLI shell (press <kbd>Ctrl+O<kbd>).
	
3. [Freemake Video Converter](http://www.freemake.com/) 

4. [Free Download Manager](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/)	can pause and resume downloads,
 also can download file's different section simultaneously, sometimes giving n times boost.
 But the best is that you need to start download only one time, and it will keep trying until file is ready
 no matter what could happen with network in between.
 
5. [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) is professional image manipulation software, that is free and  
 has a lot of extensions. (The software actually came from Linux world.)
