NOTE: This is [open-source article you can contribute and extend](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/www.nodeclipse.org/tree/gh-pages/_posts).

What I could find by googling (P.S. was not actually the best way to start):

#### DHTMLX

[site](http://www.dhtmlx.com/docs/company.shtml), [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhtmlx)

<http://www.dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSpreadsheet/>

> dhtmlxSpreadsheet is an open source spreadsheet widget written in JavaScript and PHP that allows you to quickly add an Excel-like, editable data table on a web page. It is also available as a plugin for WP, Joomla, etc.

Free for only GPL-ed projects, then $149 or $449

It exists since 2005 and grow popular, there are some plugins. However it is not fully free, and not pure JavaScript.
Though it is the closest approximation to Excel.

#### jQuery.sheet

#### EditGrid

I have not tried.

#### jqwidgets

Nice commercial widgets based on jQuery. http://www.jqwidgets.com/

<http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxgrid/index.htm#demos/jqxgrid/spreadsheet.htm>

#### SlickGrid

A friend of mine advise me [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/slickgrid), that was great help because I could not find it.
 (Now I added it into Wikipedia, so maybe you have already).
 
It is just 1 year old project hosted on GitHub, that grew popular (3000+ stars).
 However it is personal projects and the author seems to be overwhelmed with issues and Pull Requests stream. 

[project wiki](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki), [online examples](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Examples) 

#### Other lists

- [List of Online Spreadsheets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_spreadsheets)
- [Comparison of spreadsheet software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_spreadsheet_software)

### Conclusion

There are a lot of commercial tools with varying degree of quality.
I am going to try open-source SlimGrid first.
