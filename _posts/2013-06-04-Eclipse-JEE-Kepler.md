[Eclipse JEE Kepler](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index-developer.php) packaging
 [has Plug-in Development Environment package](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/compare_404861.php).
 That means that developers getting Eclipse JEE Kepler can install Nodeclipse without JSDT dependecy download (i.e. quicker)
 and second they may can Nodeclipse sources and play with them (again without additional downloads).
