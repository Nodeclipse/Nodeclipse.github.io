### Android Screen on PC

[Droid @ Screen](http://droid-at-screen.ribomation.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/ribomation/DroidAtScreen1)

Just get jar and double-click or `java -jar droidAtScreen-1.1.jar`

Note the screen refresh rate is actually limited by USB throughput,
so getting devices with USB 3.0 support, such as [Samsung_Galaxy_S5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S5) would help.

Also an option is to get USB-to-HDMI cable and connect phone to projector.

Installing DroidVNC would allow to connect to Android remotely. But this option requires rooted device.

### Trends

<http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/41411/is-there-a-trend-for-cross-platform-gui-toolkits>

> It almost seems like there's a trend against cross-platform kits. If people want to write once, run anywhere, they tend to use HTML
 - make a web site. People are only using the platform toolkits when a native look and feel is highly demanded, 
 for example on the iPhone. So if the whole reason you're bothering with the non-web app is to get native look and feel,
 it doesn't make a ton of sense to use a cross-platform kit.
