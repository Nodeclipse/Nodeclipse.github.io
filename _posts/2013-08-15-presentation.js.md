Some previous reviews:

- [5 of the Best Free HTML5 Presentation Systems](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-free-html5-presentation-systems/) By Craig Buckler | February 23, 2012    
- [6 Best HTML5/CSS3 Presentation Frameworks](http://zoomzum.com/6-best-html5css3-presentation-frameworks/) byVikas Feb 27, 2012

What I think is worth attention now is:

- Deck.js <http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/> 3600 stars (not updated for 7 months)
- Impress.js <http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js> 17000 stars
- Reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/>, [code](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) 9500 stars

I tried authoring tools for Impress.js called Strut <http://strut.io/dist/index.html>.
Looks nice, but it is not creating HTML5 presentation, but creating presentation.
Dissatisfied. Well, the project is in active development, see what future will bring.  

Personally I would like to have HTML Editor where I can drag-and-drop picture, and that would add needed HTML tags. Then markdown support.

P.S.

- Shower <https://github.com/shower/shower> <http://shwr.me/> 1300 Stars  Name is confusing, though they said they meant ['ʃəuə]. I don't know what dictionary they looked in.

I went with Reveal.js as it has [Markdown support](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown).
Also <http://slid.es/> and good [Browser-Support](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support)
However [External Markdown doesn't work in reveal.js-2.4.0](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/559)
