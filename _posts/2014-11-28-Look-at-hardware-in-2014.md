When time came to update PC, I look at hardware.
Below is what I found remarkable for this year and trends. 


### Intel puts mobile as number 1 priority with Core M

For newest 14nm process the first processors are Core M branded CPU for mobile devices like
[2-in-1](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/2-in-1/laptop-tablet.html), 
[all-in-one](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/all-in-one/all-in-one.html)
and maybe [NUC](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/overview.html).
And they are already coming in 2014 Q4.

While at the same time, 14nm Desktop CPU are planned for Q2 2015 
and low end Desktop CPU won't get 14nm update. 

### SSD goes with PCI Express

Everybody is talking about SSD and want the flash drive in their notebooks.
Usually it is [mSATA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA#mSATA)
 form factor with SATA interface,
while future interface for SSD is PCI Express.

[![sata-io.org](https://www.sata-io.org/sites/default/files/Serial-ATA-logo-Color-R.jpg)](http://www.sata-io.org/)

SATA org will not double SATA speed and SATA revision 3.0 ( 6 Gbit/s - 600 MB/s ) is the last,
but will add two PCIe lanes into [SATA Express](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA_Express)

[M.2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2) interface will be transitional form-factor used in notebooks that implements SATA Express 
with additional internal USB 3.0 port.

### AMD inside XBOX One and Play Station 4 

The PS4 and Xbox One both use an AMD GPU.
E.g. read comparison at <http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-one-vs-sony-ps4>

### 3D sensors everywhere

And talking about [Kinect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect),
 we will see it coming with all product for Windows and Max OS:

Intel promotes RealSENSE SDK for Windows

While Apple has bought original creator of Kinect [PrimeSense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimeSense)
about a year ago. No surpzie for some "revolutionary" new tech in new Apple product,
as the sense now may be small enough to be integrated into mobiles.
Google has Tango Project [10](http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/06/google-tango-project-dev-kit)

### 4K as standard monitor

Actually 4K is already supported by GPU integrated in Intel CPU
That now make up-to 50% of market,
The problem: you cannot get it via VGA D-SUB, even HDMI has limit to its refresh rate.

	1920x1080@60Hz (D-SUB)
	3840x2160@30Hz (HDMI)
	3840x2160@60Hz (DP/Mini-DP)

Some monitors start from $300

But do we really need high refresh rate on LCD ?
It turns out that for video run at 24 Hz. 

### Display Adaptive Sync

Finally with technologies like NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync / VESA's Adaptive Sync
display refresh rate will be in sync with GPU rates. (variable refresh rate)

### PC 2014 links

If you not gamer, you can go well with Intel integrated graphic,
that is now inside CPU.

Currently main-stream CPU socket is LGA 1150.
