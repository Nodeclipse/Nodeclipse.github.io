[StartExplorer](http://basti1302.github.io/startexplorer/) 
 ([sources](https://github.com/basti1302/startexplorer#release-notes))
version 1.5.0 is released.

> With "https://www.google.de" selected in an editor, "Start File Manager in this Path" brings up IE (because the URL is passed to Windows Explorer as a parameter, which in turn starts IE for this URL) and "Open in Default Application" pops up Firefox, which is set as my default browser. Doing the same on a mailto: URL brings up the default e-mail client.
