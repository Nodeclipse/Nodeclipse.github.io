# Nodeclipse Plugins Off List

### Shells, Terminals

- [![InstallLink][1]](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=909243)
MintJams Terminal Plug-in [mp](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/mintjams-terminal-plug)
// is actually local CLI Shell opened in Editor area, that lets you have many shells running in tabs.
Review: OK for long running scripts (e.g. mvn) Not supporting interaction 
(for tools like `npm init` or `bower init` impossibly to enter from keyboard),
line editing is awefull (new letters always in the end)  
Impossible to terminate running process, closing Tab causes Eclipse freeze. Is causing errors in Eclipse.
