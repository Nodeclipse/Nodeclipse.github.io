## Note mpc

Drag-and-drop installing depends on [Marketplace client (mpc)](http://eclipse.org/mpc/) (usually in <kbd>Help</kbd> -> <kbd>Eclipse Marketplace ...</kbd> menu).
If you don't have it, just install it from Kepler update site `http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler/` , check `General Purpose Tools` group.
( [bug 411752](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=411752) fixed with 4.3.1).
mpc before 4.3.1 had no dependencies, now it seems to have JDT dependency.
It is possible to install the latest mpc on any Eclipse version.
