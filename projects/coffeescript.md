CoffeeScript plugin has issue #19 when editing with Eclipse 4.3.1 platform onward.
That in effect makes it good for viewing only in the newest Eclipse versions.  
The original author stopped working for the project 2 years ago, while Nodeclipse team
lack XTest technology skills (or someone to move the project forward).

You can install it, for example, into older <a href="/enide/studio/">Enide Studio 0.5 (Eclipse 4.3 Kepler distribution)</a>
with Nodeclipse 0.5 plugins pre-installed and configured,   
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nodeclipse/files">Download it from SourceForge</a>,
then update following ["Installation Instructions"](/updates/#update-site).
