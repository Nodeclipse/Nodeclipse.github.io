title: Nodeclipse & Enide -- Our story
---

## On a new mission

In 2013 we were developing Nodeclipse core plugins
 and collecting all plugins that could help in Node.js development.
 This way we found a lot of thing that could help in Java development too.
 
## Node.js and Java are the best friends

While some are comparing Node.js vs Java and pointing why one should use 1st or 2nd,
we say "use both".
 

## Q & A 
 
> That all (Nodeclipse offerings) sounds very complicated.

Yes, we need to sit down and put it into 4 boxes. Eventually v1.0 would be correct time to do so.

> I didn't understand the relationship between Node & Java, and why Java technologies need to work with Node technologies?
 From my understanding, the Node community is developing on its own a very different set of tools.  And that those tools have little crossover to the Java community.

The ideas were defusing for long time.
Now there are inter-dependencies:
1) JHipster http://jhipster.github.io/ is using Node.js Grunt for Spring+Angular rapid application development
2) Nodeclipse CLI Installer http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/nodeclipse-cli-installer is using Node.js for installing plugins into Eclipse
3) Node-Java https://github.com/joeferner/node-java calling Java libraries from Node
4) Avatar.js Node.js port to JVM by Oracle https://avatar-js.java.net/ (you could have learned about it, if you read http://www.nodeclipse.org/ home page)

> Either way, I think it will be very important to simplify your packaging / offering to really narrow in on a very specific value proposition. 
 Otherwise, developers will not understand when they should consider using your tool suite.

That's why there is Gradle tool, Maven tool, Node.js tool, Nashorn tool etc as separate entries on Marketplace,
as well as standalone package of all that.
Developers are to install what they want or get it quicker as package.
And as mentioned before, Nodeclipse project (in 2014) is about Node.js and Java together.
