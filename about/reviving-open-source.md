Keeping this as open-source story.


Hi Piotr

GitHub issues can be seen by hardly 2-10 people, who have interested enough to look inside.
They are not public forum, but are closed and forgotten when solved.

Please take a time to play with GitHub,
it is much superior experience.

Cheers,
Paul

    Hi Piotr

    (also copied to https://github.com/Nodeclipse/EditBox/issues/1)

    It is great news for Eclipse community that the project is alive and has some plans on the road.

    Eclipse Marketplace for Nodeclipse EditBox will not be removed while at least it has some improvements comparing to version 0.0.22.


    The patch and all the commit history from 2009 is at https://github.com/Nodeclipse/EditBox
    If you are OK with the changes, we can publish newer version binaries on SourceForge
    In theory it is possibly to commit to SVN and Git from one folder, but Trunk folders made it non compatible.
    Hopefully you appreciate GitHub/git conveniences. After not using SVN for 2 years, and I am glad I have moved to git. (Eclipse Foundation moved to git too)
    I do not have plans to work with sources other than git, as I don't have time to learn and go alone with many tools for doing the same.
    So if you insist on SVN, I am afraid I won't be contributing. There are 10+ projects other than inside Nodeclipse, that I would like to look deeper, e.g. AngularJS-Eclipse
    Please consider GitHub. It is currently the most popular sources place with close to 4 000 000 users.

    When you consider new features to include, please take a look at GitHub issues, particularly
    https://github.com/Nodeclipse/EditBox/issues/6
    "should not store in preferences provided themes and always show them"

    Looking forward to see next version.

    Best regards,
    Paul

        I don't agree for what has been done.
        Please remove it from Eclipse Marketplace and other places!

        Editbox stays at SourceForge repository, yet this is Open Source project so you are free to use it in yours projects. If you need any changes in the Editbox code please send me a patch and I will include it (with all credits you deserve), in case of any serious development I'm also ok to give you membership and write access to repository. This is a common practice in Open Source development, I hope you understand that well.

        Personally I'm still interested in development of Editbox and I'm in contact with other developers which already implemented their extensions that are in testing phase now, yet I don't promise any release plans on public forum.


        Wish you all the best!

            Please comment on https://github.com/Nodeclipse/EditBox/issues/1

            Could you bless Nodeclipse to be new home for EditBox?
            Would you continue on GitHub (We can transfer EditBox to your account if you wish)

            EditBox is what many developers need, that just don't know the name.
            I was dreaming for such thing several years.



            If you not so interested, please take a time to read several pages on http://www.nodeclipse.org/
            We do need help in Java/JavaScript efforts.

            With my quick look, EditBox sources are good, but comments are missing completely.
            And as 3 years passed, I am not sure if anybody would recall details and ideas to try.

            Best regards,
            Paul
