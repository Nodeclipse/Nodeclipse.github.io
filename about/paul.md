title: Nodeclipse & Enide -- Welcome Paul

Well, I happen to become expat techie, and this is how:

1) I liked learning foreign languages, as a hobby. (Now I know 5.) In 2006 I started learning Chinese
(after playing with French & Japanese, Chinese looked like more perspective). After I understood I can't possibly do it by myself,
I enrolled on Chinese language courses and was one of 3 who finished them (out of 15 students who started).
In 2008 my second teacher (who was Chinese) introduced me to a girl, who is my wife now. We have 10 months old son.
(I can check for photo at home if you need)

2) Before coming to China I worked mostly with Java and finance software. When we moved to China in 2010,
I was lucky to find interesting job in BancLogix.
We were doing platform and clients for Foreign Exchange currency trading. I worked as Team Lead, then close with CTO
as Software Development Supervisor.

In 2012 I was invited to work for RenRen 人人网 (Chinese Facebook) as Project Manager。But I left after working for 4 months.
 The company was expending, and the team was great, but there were too many bad signs inside our project, "the smells". 
 Being a new-comer and a foreigner, I could not change nor accept the situation, so I just quit.
(Later I discovered that the project was closed in 5 months afterwards and everyone fired)

Since 2012 I work for Funshion Online 风行网 http://www.funshion.com/ (Chinese Netflix)
All 3 interviews were giving good impression, I liked the level of Agile and engineering inside company.
Also company liked that I used Funshion software. (Before it was not so widely known, but now the company has 400 000 000 monthly users )
I work as Architect inside Commercial Product R&D dep, related to advertising business (that allows company to stream video for free)

So events is not the only thing I do. For me it is more like open training (we have some tech meet-up inside Funshion office)
http://www.meetup.com/BeijingSoftwareCraftsmanship/
By chance (by trying hard) we did one really big one Eclipse Day China http://eclipse-china.github.io/Day/
so after that some companies contact me and I agree to do it (in personal time) as I liked the topics.

What I do as open source on GitHub are JavaScript and Java tools for Node.js, Java 8, maven, gradle
as Nodeclipse & Enide http://www.nodeclipse.org/
That is international project with members from China, Japan, Europe and less from US/Canada.
I joined it as contributor and now leading development.

So events are what were trainings: share what you have learned and developed
to learn and understand it better. (Have you ever noticed when you describe an issue you can find better words of find a solution?)

The event is Spring IO user group Beijing event on April 12th
